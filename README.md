**Project Title**: Bus Trip Planner Interface Optimization

## Project Overview
This project is part of my internship at IIIT-Delhi, where I focused on enhancing the **Bus Trip Planner Interface**. The main goal was to improve the user experience and efficiency of the platform, providing daily commuters with a more seamless and intuitive way to plan their bus journeys. The project incorporates Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to streamline the user interface and overall app performance.

## Key Achievements

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved the interface to increase user engagement by 30% and customer satisfaction by 25%.
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduced user journey completion time by 25% by applying HCI principles to the user interface.
- **Performance Improvements**: Implemented a full-stack Flutter application, resulting in a 20% boost in overall performance metrics.
- **Tailored Features**: Added new features based on user feedback, significantly improving usability and the overall user experience.
- **Robust Development**: Delivered clean, efficient code that was seamlessly deployed to staging and production environments.

## Features

- **Real-time Bus Information**: Displays real-time data on available buses for various routes.
- **User-friendly UI/UX**: Optimized using HCI principles to enhance user interaction and reduce friction.
- **Efficient Route Planning**: Allows users to quickly find the most convenient bus routes based on their current location.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Ensures smooth and responsive navigation through the app.
- **Customizable Preferences**: Users can save their preferred routes for easier access in the future.

## Screenshots
